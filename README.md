Aircraft Engine Maintenance Prognosis using ML Classifiers and ML Regressors
ML methods are employed to foresee when an aircraft engine will need maintenance. Though the methods are not dependable, there are still some gray areas where improvement is required. By understanding the engine design, it is possible to know when engine failure occurs. Many ML methods can be undertaken to get more accurate results. A comparative study of existing methods determines the RUL of aero engines. The dataset employed in this study includes sensor readings and engine monitoring.
